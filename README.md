# Northcoders News Application

Northcoders news is a social news aggregation app, built as a project during the Front-End module of my time Northcoders. Northcoders news displays articles with user-rating and comments, which are divided up into specific topics. Users can browse, vote and comment on articles. They can also vote on existing comments, as well as add news topics and post new articles. 

The website is deployed on netlify <a href='https://northcodersnewsjn.netlify.com/'>here</a>.

This news application makes asynchronous API calls to my own server which can be found on my github <a href='https://github.com/joshuanewman1993/BE-NC-knews'>here</a>. This was built during the Back-End module of Northcoders. You can find the deployed version of the API hosted on heroku
